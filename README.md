# Overview

In a typical bike sharing company, an owner may suffer from loss by buying more or less bikes. In this project, I have predicted how many bikes are required to fulfill the supply using historical data present in the dataset available in the Bike-Sharing-Dataset folder. This is my first assignment for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation 1.

# Running the code

If you want to run the notebook(using anaconda)
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/pratzz/DLND-first-neural-network.git
    cd DLND-first-neural-network
    # Create a conda environment if you want or use one you already have
    conda create --name YOUR_ENV_NAME python=3
    source activate YOUR_ENV_NAME
    conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
    jupyter notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```

You can also click on the file Your_first_neural_network.ipynb here and see my results.
