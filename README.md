# DLND-first-neural-network

This is the git repository for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation assignment 1. It implements a simple neural network for bike ridership prediction based on the dataset available in the Bike-Sharing-Dataset folder.

# Running the code

If you want to run the notebook(using anaconda)
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/RomelTorres/DLND-first-neural-network.git
    cd DLND-first-neural-network
    # Create a conda environment if you want or use one you already have
    conda create --name YOUR_ENV_NAME python=3
    source activate YOUR_ENV_NAME
    conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
    jupyter notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```

You can also click on the file Your_first_neural_network.ipynb here and see my results.
